# Seeweb IoT project

SeewebIoT project is an example project with the aim of explain how to use SeewebIoT solution with Qt5, raspberry Pi and Arduino to build an IoT project. Even if you're not an expert, you'll be able to make your first IoT projet easily. Every documentation is available in `docs/` path.
SeewebIoT solution helps to implement Astarte platform in your IoT projects without thinking about setting up and mainteining your Host.

###### NOTICE
Realm URL, tokens and dashboard credentials are provided by Seeweb when IoT service will be activated. Grafana server will be already installed on your Host.
